# Documentation for getting OS APIs in Power BI

## Introduction

This is the Getting Started Guide for using OS APIs within Power BI. There are a number of ways to get the OS APIs in Power BI and the best will depend on your own skills and goals. The options broadly fall into three categories: use a coding language such as R or Python, use power query within Power BI or use a custom visual from the visual store. Visuals are simply add-ons for Power BI that give you a custom visualisation or the ability to bring in other data types more easily. 
The APIs covered in this guide are the OS Maps API & OS Vector Tile API for the purposes of background mapping and the OS Places API. The following ways of integrating the APIs will be covered:

•	Mapbox Visual - a visual used to get the OS Vector Tile API integrated in Power BI as background mapping.

•	Icon Map - a visual used to get the OS Maps API integrated in Power BI as background mapping. 

•	R Custom Visuals - a method used to create a custom visual using OS Maps API and the programming language R.

•	ArcGIS Maps for Power BI - an ESRI visual using ArcGIS to integrate OS Maps API with power BI.

•	CadCorp - a CadCorp visual used to integrate OS APIs with Power BI.

•	Power query – use the built in power query functions to bring in and page OS places API.

•	Python – use a python script to bring in OS Places API.

•	R- use an R script to bring in OS Places API.
